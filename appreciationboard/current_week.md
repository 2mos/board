2. 8 warning tickets handed out
```

Don't be disheartened if you've received a warning ticket, let's change it this week by studying consistently and learning from last week's mistakes 💪 Trust me I really hate handing out warnings especially to those whom I want to see here, expecting y'all to be the shit this time 😁
